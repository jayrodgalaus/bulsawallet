<h4>About</h4>
Bulsawallet is a simple budget tracking tool created with native HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It does not have any dependencies, but it does need internet to run as its styling and functionalities are taken from online CDNs. 
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Bulsawallet is meant as mobile-only, and therefore does not have a desktop view design.</li>
  <li>The tool is not connected to any database, but instead uses the browser's <code>local storage</code>. Feel free to modify the code and connect it to a database if needed.</li>
</ul>
